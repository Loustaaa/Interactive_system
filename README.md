Make sure to fork this project into your portfolio space before progressing 
with the practical. if you do not do this, then your changes may not be saved

A video showing a step by step on how to do this can be found [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/4ecb0839-6fd9-48bc-b563-3ab2122ef011)

## Practical 2.1

In the `variables.java` file, inside the main method create 4 variables with
the following assignments. Use appropriate types for each of the variables

- name: {Your Name}
- cards: 52
- happy: true
- change: 2.5

### Practical 2.1.1

Extension: In the main method, take your variables and print them to console

Expected Output:

```
Jordan
52
true
2.5
```

### Practical 2.1.2

Extension: Reassign the `happy` variable to false, and reassign the `change`
variable to 5.1 and print these variables to console

Expected Output:

```
Jordan
52
false
5.1
```

## Practical 2.2

In the `Input.java` file complete the main method so that it accepts input from
the keyboard and prints it back to the console

### Practical 2.2.1

Extension: Modify the main method so that you can input twice and print out to
console the input from the keyboard

## Practical 2.3

In the `Variables` class and in the method `binaryToDecimal`, complete the
 method to convert a binary number to a decimal
 
*Hint* use the Integer class

## Practical 2.3.1

Extension: In the `Variables` class and in the method `binaryToHex`, complete
 the method to convert a binary number to a hexadecimal
 
## Practical 2.3.2

Extension: In the `Variables` class and in the method `binaryToOctal`, complete
 the method to convert a binary number to an octal

## Practical 2.4

In the `Circle` class main method, write code to print the area and perimeter
 of a circle when given the radius.
 
 *Hint:* Use `Math.pi()`

Area = pi * radius^2
Perimeter = 2 * pi * radius

Expected Output given radius 7.5:

```
Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689                                                                              
Area is = 176.71458676442586
```

## Practical 2.5

In the `Triangle` class main method, write code to print the area and perimeter
 of a triangle when given the height and width.
 
 Expected Output given width 5.6, and height 8.5
 
```
28.20 
47.60 
```
